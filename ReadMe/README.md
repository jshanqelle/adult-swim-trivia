# Adult Swim Trivia

A browser-based quiz game that tests your knowledge of popular Adult Swim shows. This project features two quizzes (**Rick & Morty and The Boondocks**) with a 10-second countdown timer, a score tracker, and dynamic question rendering using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Background:
I chose this type of game because it allows me to be creative. Who doesn't like a really good quiz about your favorite shows. I like educating people on things I love or take intrest in. This is one of the best ways to do it. Especially when you can quiz about fun facts most people don't know.

## Features

- **Quiz Selection:** Choose between two quizzes: Rick & Morty or The Boondocks.
- **Timer:** A 30-second countdown timer for each quiz.
- **Score Tracker:** Earn points for correct answers (10 points per correct answer).
- **Dynamic Quiz Generation:** Questions and options are dynamically rendered from JavaScript data.
- **Responsive Design:** The game is styled with a dark theme and is mobile-friendly.
- **Instant Feedback:** Correct answers are highlighted in green and wrong answers in red.

## Next Steps:

+ I plan on addding more features and add more quizes to the game from my other favorite adult sim shows like Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Robot Chicken, American Dad, Attack on Titan, Bob's Burgers, Family Guy, Futurama, and Mr. Pickles to name a few. I always want to expand the questions to 20 instead of 5. I would like to add more graphics, animations and sounds. I want to make it a really fun experience, for example if you lose a question then a pie with smack the screen of one of the characters will boo you depending on the show you choose.
